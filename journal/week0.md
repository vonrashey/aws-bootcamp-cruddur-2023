# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

After watching **Week 00** videos, I worked on the following as part of my homework:

1. Napkin Design 
This is a general design or sketch of the Cruddur app that I will be building during the bootcamp. Its a basic idea of the application, its input, processes and output requirements.

2. Conceptual Design
This is an improved version of the napkin design showing the requirements of the application


3. Logical Design

This is the logical design of the application, showing the building blocks (input, processes and output) of the application at a higher level.


4. Billing Alarm
6. Install AWS CLI
7.

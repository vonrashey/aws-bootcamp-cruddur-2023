# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

After watching all **Week 00** videos, I worked on the following as part of my homework:

**1. Napkin Design**

This is a general design or sketch of the Cruddur app that I will be building during the bootcamp. Its a basic idea of the application, its input, processes and output requirements.

**2. Conceptual Design**


This is an improved version of the napkin design showing the requirements of the application:

**3. Logical Design**

This is the logical design of the application, showing the building blocks (input, processes and output) of the application at a higher level.
